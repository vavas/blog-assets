One of the first and most impressive characteristics I saw when I started to study Elixir was the powerful yet simple built-in tools to help developers write documentation and tests.

A very special feature is the called `doctest`, which is a test that lives inside your documentation. With such tests, you can assure your docs are up-to-date, because whenever you run your tests, the tests inside your documentation will also be verified. **Really awesome**!

In this article I'll show you how to write a simple program with unit tests and how to document your code and generate a beautiful HTML documentation page.

Let's start!

## Specification
Our program should implement the solution for the [staircase problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/staircase).

The program will receive a positive number `n` and should return a staircase right-aligned composed of `#` symbols and spaces, with a height and width equals to `n`.

Example:

```
input > 6
output >
     #
    ##
   ###
  ####
 #####
######
```

## Creating the project
To create the project, type the following command in your terminal:

```
mix run staircase
```

With the structure generated by mix we already can write our program and our test files. Let's now install the `ExDoc` library that will generate the HTML documentation page for us.

## Installing ExDoc
Go to `mix.exs` file and add the following line inside the `deps` function:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:ex_doc, "~> 0.16"}
  ]
end
```

Now all you need to do is run the command `mix deps.get` to install the dependency.
