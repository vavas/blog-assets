In this article, you will see a compilation of concepts, features and other interesting aspects of Elixir and Erlang that made me choose such ecosystem to be my focus of studying in the backend land for the next years.

My first impression when I started to read about Elixir and discovered Erlang for consequence, was that the **true disruptive technology is the Erlang VM**. This thought was actually confirmed by a quote from Saša Jurić in one of his tweets:

> _"The most important aspect of Elixir is in fact the Erlang VM."_

José Valim, author of Elixir, replied to him confirming such affirmation so without doubts it is a true sentence :)

Don't get me wrong. Elixir is a super nice and beautiful language, with a bunch of excellent tools and features, but you can't write robust distributed fault-tolerant systems with only a nice language, and that's where the Erlang ecosystem comes in.

Let's summarize all the interesting aspects of Elixir and Erlang:

## Erlang VM

- BEAM (Björn's Erlang Abstract Machine) is the Erlang's Virtual Machine.
- It was developed to address:
  - long-running systems
  - to be capable to handle many tasks concurrently (frequent context switches)
  - to deliver soft real-time
