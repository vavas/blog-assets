For those that want to start building React applications, I highly recommend the beginner friendly book called [The Road to Learn React](https://leanpub.com/the-road-to-learn-react) by [Robin Wieruch](https://twitter.com/rwieruch).

In this book, you will build a simple Hacker News client clone.

To keep the application simple, the author didn't split all components in its own files, so the code is concentrated in the App.js file.

As an exercise, I created the **react-hn** repository, where I splitted all those components in their own folder/file.

You can check the source code [here](https://github.com/ericdouglas/react-hn) and the live demo [here](https://ericdouglas.github.io/react-hn/).

Enjoy!
